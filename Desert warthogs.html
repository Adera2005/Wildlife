<p>
The desert warthog is a member of the pig family.It has a large,warty head,a coarse mane and two pairs of tusks.Unlike the common warthog,which can be found
across most of Africa,the desert warthog only lives in Kenya,Ethopia and Somalia.It lives in savannah and shrubland habitats,where they feed on grass and other vegetation and uses abondoned aardvrak burrows as a place of shelter.
</p>

<p>
The desert warthog is listed by the IUCN as least concern.However the population faces several risks in Kenya, including growing human and livestock numbers.This increases competition for both water and food.
