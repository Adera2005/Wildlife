The <font color="blue">African savannah elephant</font> is the world's largest land mammal.It lives across many different habitats,including open savannah,desert,and forest.As these animals roam they play an important role within their ecosystems.They disperse seeds through their dung,helping to fertilize the land;they clear paths through vegetation and overgrown bush,promoting plant diversity;and they use their tusks and feet to access water in dry  riverbeeds,creating small watering holes for other animals. 

</p>

<p>
Africa Savannah elephants are found in<font color="blue"> 23 countries across Africa</font>.They have large populations in Kenya,Botswana,Namibia,Tanzania,South Africa,Zambia and Zimbabwe
</p>

<p>
The IUCN classies the African savannah elephant as <font color="blue">endangered</font>.This means it is at a very high risk of extinction in the wild.Their numbers are also decreasing.These elephants are poached for their <font color="blue">ivory</font> and their natural habitats are being converted into agricultural land and infrastructure by expanding human populations.

IFAW is working to protect African savannah elephants and conserve their remaining habitat through our Room to Roam initiative
