<p>
There are two species of hyenas in Kenya-the striped hyena and the spotted hyena.
They can be found throughout Africa,in all habitats except rainforests.
</p>

<p>
The spotted hyena( also called the laughing hyena) is the largest hyena species,with the females being larger than the males.Their coats are patterned
with dark spots.These animals hunt fish,birds and even hippo calves and can work in packs to take down wilderbeasts or antelopes.
</p>

<p>
Striped hyenas are lesser knwon than their spotted cousins.They are more scavengers than hunters and typically come out at night to feed on carcasses left by other animals
</p>

<p>
The spotted hyena is listed by the IUCN as least concern,and the striped hyena is near threatened.Human-wildlife is the main threat to their survival.
