<p>
The dik-dik is a type of dwarf antelope that lives in arid regions of East Africa.They can live in such barren environments because they get water from the vegetation they eat.They also take cover in undergrowth to protect themselves from preditors,including eageles and cats.
</p>

<p>
There are four species of dik-diks, but just two of them live in Kenya.These include Guenther's dik-dik and Krik's dik-dik.Krik's is the largest dik-dik,though it is still small in comparison to other antelopes.It stands at just 45 centimeters(18 inches) tall and weighs only 7.2 kilograms(15.8 pounds)
Guenther's dik-dik is smaller but has a longer snout. 
</p>

<p>
The IUCN lists both Kirk's dik dik and Guenther's dik-dik as least concern,though they are threatened by expanding agricultural settlements and excessive hunting in some arear
